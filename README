This repository contains the following files:

.vimrc, the author's vimrc file.

        This file is heavily commented. I guess the most "interesting" part is
        the affectation of the backupdir and directory options (the
        directories where the backup files and the swap files are written
        respectively). The file creates and uses the directories ~/.vim/backup
        and ~/.vim/swap.


.gtkrc-2.0, the author's configuration file for GTK.

        Thanks to this file, there is no unpleasant white patch at the bottom
        of the gVim window when gVim is used with a window manager that does
        not respect the size hints (e.g. a tiling window manager).


install_thierr26_vim-gtk_config, a shell script to install the files.

        This script copies .vimrc and .gtkrc-2.0 to the user's home directory
        or to the directory specified on the command line. Launch the script
        with the --help option for a complete documentation.
